# Startup_Funding_Analysis
Description: This project focuses on analyzing startup funding data to uncover insights about funding trends in the startup ecosystem. Using Streamlit, an interactive and user-friendly web application was built to help users explore the data, including insights on investment trends, top investors, funded sectors, and funding distribution over time.

Key Features:

Interactive Dashboard: Users can explore startup funding data through various visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and pie charts. The dashboard offers the ability to filter data by year, industry, and funding type.
Funding Trend Analysis: Users can analyze how funding patterns have changed over the years, identify the most active investors, and the sectors receiving the highest investments.
Geographic Insights: A map-based visualization allows users to explore how funding is distributed across different cities and regions.
Top Startups: A dedicated section provides details on top-funded startups, including funding amount, stage of funding, and investor information.
Tools and Technologies:

Python: For data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: For cleaning and preprocessing the startup funding dataset.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: To generate visualizations that provide clear insights into funding patterns.
Streamlit: To create a smooth, interactive experience, enabling users to explore funding trends and key insights in real time.
This project is an excellent showcase of how data visualization can be used to analyze real-world business data and identify investment patterns in the startup ecosystem. It offers hands-on experience with tools like Python, Pandas, and Streamlit to create interactive data-driven applications.
